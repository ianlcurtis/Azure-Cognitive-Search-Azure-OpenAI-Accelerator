        "From the Azure OpenAI documentation ([HERE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/embeddings?tabs=python)), An **embedding** is a special format of data representation that can be easily utilized by machine learning models and algorithms. The embedding is an information dense representation of the semantic meaning of a piece of text. Each embedding is a vector of floating point numbers, such that the distance between two embeddings in the vector space is correlated with semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format. For example, if two texts are similar, then their vector representations should also be similar. \n",
        "\n",
        "To address the challenge of accommodating context within the token limit of a Language Model (LLM), the solution involves the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Segmenting Documents**: Divide the documents into smaller segments or chunks.\n",
        "2. **Vectorization of Chunks**: Transform these chunks into vectors using appropriate techniques.\n",
        "3. **Vector Semantic Search**: Execute a semantic search using vectors to identify the top chunks similar to the given question.\n",
        "4. **Optimal Context Provision**: Provide the LLM with the most relevant and concise context, thereby achieving an optimal balance between comprehensiveness and lengthiness.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Notice that **the documents chunks are already done in Azure Search**. *ordered_content* dictionary (created a few cells above) contains the chunks of each document. So we don't really need to chunk them again, but we still need to make sure that we can be as fast as possible and that we are below the max allowed input token limits of our selected OpenAI model."

        "Our ultimate goal is to rely solely on vector indexes. While it is possible to manually code parsers with OCR for various file types and develop a scheduler to synchronize data with the index, there is a more efficient alternative: **Azure Cognitive Search is soon going to release automated chunking strategies and vectorization within the next months**, so we have three options: \n",
        "1. Wait for this functionality while in the meantime manually push chunks and its vectors to the vector-based indexes \n",
        "2. Fill up the vector-based indexes on-demand, as documents are discovered by users\n",
        "3. Use custom skills (for chunking and vectorization) and use knowledge stores in order to create a vector-base index from a text-based-ai-enriched index at ingestion time. See [HERE](https://github.com/Azure/cognitive-search-vector-pr/blob/main/demo-python/code/azure-search-vector-ingestion-python-sample.ipynb) for instructions on how to do this.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook we are going to implement Option 2: **Create vector-based indexes per each text-based indexes and fill them up on-demand as documents are discovered**. Why? because is simpler and quick to implement, while we wait for Option 1 to become a feature of Azure Search Engine (which is the automation of Option 3 inside the search engine).\n",
        "\n",
        "As observed in Notebooks 1 and 2, each text-based index contains a field named `vectorized` that we have not utilized yet. We will now harness this field. The objective is to avoid vectorizing all documents at the time of ingestion (Option 3). Instead, we can vectorize the chunks as users search for or discover documents. This approach ensures that we allocate funds and resources only when the documents are actually required. Typically, in an organization with a vast repository of documents in a data lake, only 20% of the documents are frequently accessed, while the rest remain untouched. This phenomenon mirrors the [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) found in nature."

Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of Rt. In the first assumption, Rt was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with Rt\\u2009=\\u20091.9, 2.6, or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258, and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, Rt was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (Rt\\u2009=\\u20093.1, 2.6, and 1.9) to below 1 (Rt\\u2009=\\u20090.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public health intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077–84,520 or 55,869–81,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce Rt to an ideal level and control the infection.',\n               'score': 0.03229166567325592})])"

Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of Rt. In the first assumption, Rt was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with Rt\\u2009=\\u20091.9, 2.6, or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258, and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, Rt was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (Rt\\u2009=\\u20093.1, 2.6, and 1.9) to below 1 (Rt\\u2009=\\u20090.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public health intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077–84,520 or 55,869–81,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce Rt to an ideal level and control the infection.', metadata={'source': 'https://blobstoragejed5nzg3k2jp6.blob.core.windows.net/csv/all_sources_metadata.csv'})]"

Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of Rt. In the first assumption, Rt was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with Rt\\u2009=\\u20091.9, 2.6, or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258, and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, Rt was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (Rt\\u2009=\\u20093.1, 2.6, and 1.9) to below 1 (Rt\\u2009=\\u20090.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public health intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077–84,520 or 55,869–81,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce Rt to an ideal level and control the infection.', metadata={'source': 'https://blobstoragejed5nzg3k2jp6.blob.core.windows.net/csv/all_sources_metadata.csv'})],\n 'question': '2019 Coronavirus Disease?',\n 'language': 'English',\n 'output_text': 'The 2019 Coronavirus Disease, also known as COVID-19, is caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2).
